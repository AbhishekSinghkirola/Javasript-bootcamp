       * What is Object Oriented Programming
       *
       * It is an programming paradiagm (style of the code)
       *
       * What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP)?
       * -- It is an programming paradiagm that is based on objects
       * -- we use objects to model(describe) real-world or abstract features
       * -- Object may contain data (properties) and code (methods). By Using objects, we pack data and the corresponding behavior into one block
       * -- In OOP objects are self contained pieces/blocks of code
       * -- Objects are building block of applications and interact with one another
       * -- Interactions happen through a public interface(API): methods that the code outside of the object can access and use to communicate with the object
       *
       *
       * CLASSES AND INSTANCES (TRADITIONAL OOP)
       * CLASS : like a blue print from which we can create new objects
       *
       * INSTANCE : real object that we can use in or code and created by that class
       *
       * 
       * NOTe :: the process of creating objects/instance is known as instantiation
       *
       * THE 4 FUNDAMENTAL OOP PRINCIPLES
       * 1. Abstraction
       * 2. Encapsulation
       * 3. Inheritance
       * 4. Polymorphism
       *
       * ABSTRACTION :
       * ignoring or hiding details that don't matter, allowing us to get an overview perspective of the thing we'he implementing,
       * insted of messing with details that don't really matter to our implementation
       *
       * ENCAPSULATION :
       * keeping properties and methods private inside the class, so they are not accessible from outside the class. Some methods can be exposed as public Interface (API)
       *
       * INHERITANCE
       * Making all properties and methods of a certain class availabe to a child class, forming a hierarchial relationhip bewtween classes.This allow us to reuse common logic and to model real-world relationships.
       * 
       * POLYMORPHISM
       * A Child class can overwrite a method inherited from a parent class.
