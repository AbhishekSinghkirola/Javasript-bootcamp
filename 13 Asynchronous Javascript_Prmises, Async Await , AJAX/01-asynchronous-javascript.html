       * Asynchronous Javascript
       *
       * Synchronous Codes
       * -- Code were executing line by line in order which were they defined
       *
       * -- Each line of code wait to finish the prev line
       * -- long running task blocks the thread of execution
       * eg: alert or set timeout
       *
       * Asynchronous code is executed after a task that runs in the background finishes
       * -- Asynchornous code in non-blocking
       * -- Executions does not wait for asynchronous task to finish its work
       *
       * eg of asynchronous javascript
       * --  Geolocation Api
       * -- Loading images
       * -- timers
       * -- eventListener
       * -- AJAX Call --most use case
       * etc
       *
       *
       *
       * AJAX
       *  Asynchronous Javascript and XML : Allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way . With AJAX calls, we can request data from web servers dynamically.
       *
       *
       * AJAX Works
       * client (request)<====> web server (usually a web API)
       *
       *
       * API
       * Application Programming Interface :
       * Peice of software that can be used by another peice of software, in order to allow applictions to talk to each other
       *
       * -- There are be many types of API in web development
       * DOM API, Geolocation API, Own class API, online APIS
       * 
       * Online API : Application running on a server , that receives request for data, and sends data back as response
       * 
       * -- note: we can build owr Web APIs (requires back-end development eg, with node.js) or use 3rd-party API
       * 
       * 
       * API Data Formats
       * 
       * XML
       * JSON
