      // Here in this example we has mispelled the variable name on first if condition so if we do not use the strict mode it didn't gives us error while strict mode gives an error

      /**
       * Strict Mode introduce a short list of variable names that are reserved for features that might be added to the laanguage a bit later
       * **/

      //  const interface = 'Audio';

      // We cannot use these variable name because they were reserved it is similar like that we cannot use if as a variable name because it is reserved keyword in js
