      /**
       * Javascript - Js is a hight lavel, object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language
       * programming language - It is basically a tool that allow us to write code that will instruct to computer to do something
       * high level language thats why we do not worry about the computer memory while running the program
       * object oriented - based on concepts of objects
       * Multi paradiagm - its is so  flexible and verstile such as we can use all kinds of programming styles such as imperatieva and declarative programming styles , different way of destructuring our code
       * imperative way - instruct computer  what you want and f=get the desired output
       * declarative way - tell the computer what you want
       **/

      //example of imperativee programming
      const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      const result = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        result.push(array[i] * 2);
      }
      console.log(result);

      //  example of declarative way - we use a high order function given by language
      let result2 = array.map((value) => {
        return value * 2;
      });
      console.log(result2);

      /**
        * Role Of JS in web Development
        * 
        * HTML , CSS and JS these three technollogies worked together to build a beautiful user interactive website
        * 
        * Here, HTML is responsible for the content of the page - text, images, videos etx
        * CSS is responsible for the presentation - style color , laying out the elements
