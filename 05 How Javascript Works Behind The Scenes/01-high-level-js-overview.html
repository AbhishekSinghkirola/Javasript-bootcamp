      /**
       * What is Javasript ?
       * Javascript is a hight level, multi paradiagm, object oriented Programming.
       *
       * Let's get high level overview of this new term..
       * Javascript is a High Level prototype based object oriented  multi paradiagm interpreted or just in time compiled dynamic single threaded garbage collected Programming Language with first class functions and a non blocking event loop concurrency model
       *
       * HIGH LEVEL
       * -- in programming we need to manage our resources(memory) but in high level language like js we do not worry about to allocate the memory to the variable because Js engine do that for us because it have something known as abstraction (Something happen but the functanility were hidden)
       *
       * GARBAGE COLLECTED
       * -- Then again Js have something known as garbage collection which basically use an algorithm to mark an unsed variable and removes it from our memory heap
       *
       * INTERPRETED OR JUST IN TIME COMPILED LANGUAGE
       * -- Basically computer understand machine code i.e. o's and 1's but we write human readable js code so we need a compiler or an interpreter which basically do this for us js have some modern browser which basically uses both compiler and interpreter together so js have just in time compilation
       *
       * MULTI-PARADIGM
       * -- Paradigm - Basically an approach or mindset of struturing code, which will direct your coding style and technique; there are three most popular paradiagm available : procedural, object oriented, and functional programming . And there is imperative and declarative way are also present
       *
       * PROTOTYPE-BASED OBJECT-ORIENTED
       * -- Js have almost everything is object except primitive types(string, integers, boolean etc) and we use . using array methods this is because of prototypal inheritance i.e we create an array which take the blueprint available for that array prototype
       *
       * FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS
       * -- functions are simply treated as variables or we can pass them on other function or retrun them.
       *
       * DYNAMIC
       * -- Js is dynamically typed language i.e we do not mention the data type while initialization js engine automatically detects it for us or we  can change its type at any point in the pprogram; so we can say that js is loosely typed language or weakly typed language
       *
       * SINGLE THREADED
       * --Single threaded means js do one task at a time.thread is basically js execute program inside processor
       *
       *
       * What if we want more task at same time?
       * Then understand concurrency model and event loop
       *
       * CONCURENCY MODEL
       * -- How js handles ultiple task at a time
       *
       * NON BLOCKING EVENT LOOP CONCURRENCY MODEL
       * -- when js have multiple task at same time and some task were longer than they blocked our main thread so js engine run that task in backgroound and after completion take them in to main theread
       *
