      /**
       * Hoisting
       * -- The Phenomena where we can access variables or functions before initialization
       *
       * In memory creation phase in Execution context
       * first hoisiting were performed in which all variables and function were assigned with value undefined and function body respectively
       * but in function expressions or arrow function the value stored is undefined becz it also treated as variable
       * and function declared with let and const in temporal Dead Zone
       *
       * But in the case of let and const hoisting behave differently
       * if we use let and const variables before initialization it will gives us reference error : cannot access variable before initialization
       * due to Temporal Dead Zone
       *
       * Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
       * -- The time between the hoisting of let and const to initialize them with some values is known as temporal dead zone
       *
       * Types of Errors :
       *
       * 1. Type error
       * -- occur when we do some mistake on type like : if we decclare a var with const keyword and initialize it again with some value it gives type error
       *
       * 2. syntax error
       * -- the error occur when we write something worng way like : we declare const variable without any value
       *
       * 3. Reference Error
       * -- 3.1 use let and const before initialzation i.e Temporal Dead Zone period it will give reference error : connot user variable before intialization
       * -- 3.2 use a variable which is not present in the program it will give reference erroe : x is not defined
