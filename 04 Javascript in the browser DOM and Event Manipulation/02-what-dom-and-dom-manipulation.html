      /**
       *  DOM - Document Objeect Model
       *   It is a structured representation of HTML Documents. Allows js to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them
       *    eg. - change html tags, attribute , text and also able to change css styles
       * 
       * DOM is automatically created by the browser as soon a HTML page loads to the browser , and stored in a tree like structure, in this tree each element is like object
       *
       * 
       * DOM and DOM methods are not the part of Js , it is part of Web API
       * Web API is like libraries that browser implement that can access by Js (also written in js)
       * API - Application Programming Interface
